<h1>Who is piccolo dolcé?</h1>
	<h2>The story of a small business all begins... </h2>
	<p>During the first lockdown in 2020, amidst the Covid pandemic, Jo Mohammadi needed something  to do. She took one look at macarons - notouriously known for being difficult to make - and got to work.</p>
<p>A full year, three-thousand macarons made and a very well-fed family later, we land in June of 2021. Jo decided that having perfected her recipe and technique, it was time to open her hard work up to the public. Our Melbourne-based small business is now thriving.</p>
	<p><blockquote>"This business has helped me to realise that all dreams require hard work, dedication and determination."</blockquote></p>
