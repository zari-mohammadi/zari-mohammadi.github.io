							<li>"Loved the custom created farm yard macarons that were created for my daughters birthday party, they were popular with adults and children and I loved the flavours.
Toffee apple, pineapple and watermelon were amazing!
Since my first taste I have continued to buy the sample packs that are available and OMG!
Vanilla, so so good, Bounty and orange and poppyseed all new favourites of mine.
Amazing variety in flavours and packing is perfect for gifts.
Thanks Piccolo Dolce' for the confusing weight gain ðŸ˜˜" <blockquote>- Lisa</blockquote>
